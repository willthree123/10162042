                        <p>First is the main way to collect data is using sensors.
                            There are a lot of different types of sensors that were
                            installed in IoT devices, for example: </p>

                                    <li>used for detecting nearby
                                        objects using the technology of electromagnetic
                                        radiation</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>used for detecting the change of temperature</li>
                                </ul>

                            and each sensor is <b>connected with gateways</b> so that they can
                            <i><u>relay the collected data of a server in the cloud.</i></u>

                                range</b>. There are 3 different types of antennas:

                        <p>As mentioned above sensors will have a gateway to connect to the servers but gateways lack

                        <p>It is like a microprocessor but it does not equal to a microprocessor. As a

                            <b>peripherals</b> all embedded onto a <i><u>single chip</u></i>. So it is basically a

                With IoT data collection, the collected data is far more larger, so with more data the <b>predicted
                    accuracy can be increased</b>.
                As we have a lot more information, we can leverage to <u><i>make better decisions</i></u>, and
                <u><i>many more variables</i></u>
                to consider when predicting maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data analysis is a process , which is used to <b>examine big and small data sets with varying data
                    properties</b> to <u><i>extract meaningful conclusions</i></u>
                and <u><i>actionable insights</i></u>. And with the data collected by those devices we still need to
                turn that data to information in order to use that
                information to take action later.
            </p>
            <p>
                As figure 1 mentioned it has three types of ways that will do <b>data analysis</b>, <b>user
                    interface</b>, <b>analytics of business application</b> and
                <b> backend system</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <u><i> analytics of business applications</i></u>, businesses can use this type of data to
                <b>minimize lost</b> and <b>maximize profit</b>. For example, companies can use IoT to
                predict maintenance. It will <b>address the potential problem </b>to the company <b>before a failure
                    occurs</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <u><i>back-end system</i></u>, is <u><i>back-end-data-sharing</i></u>, A company can use this to
                <b>access information from all of the devices</b> working inside the company building as organized
                together
